# Timer App ‚è±Ô∏è (simplices)

A simple website that demonstrates a sample timer along with the logic for calculating the difference and countdown. It is worth mentioning that React.js and Next.js have been used for the implementation. Additionally, it should be noted that the Next.js structure of this project is based on the page route type.

Moreover, the npm package manager has been used, and for testing, you can run the following command:

` npm run dev `

And for building:

` npm run build `

Then start:

` npm run start `

Feel free to make changes ü§ù.
